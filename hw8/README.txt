YOUR NEW TEST CASES
Submitted as an input file named my_input.txt.  Briefly describe how
this test exercises the corner cases of your implementation.  Why is
this test case interesting and/or challenging?

the corner case included in this test case are:
1. add people with the same name existing in list;
2. remove people with no existing name;
3. add friendship with existing friendship, no existing person and the same person;
4. remove friendship with no existing person and not existing friendship

But in order to pass the test in server, I need to comment all these std::cerr. but it still works.


EXTRA CREDIT

I have develop this extra credit part, if we donâ€™t need this function, can just comment the changeWord() function in the pass_messages function in the Graph.cpp
