SUMMARY OF RESULTS: 
Summarize your results on the provided examples.  Were you able to
construct a perfect hash function?  If not, how close did you get (how
many collisions)?  If yes, what was the smallest perfect hash you were
able to construct for the different examples?  What was your
compression ratio?  Did you make any additional test cases?

I can construct a perfect hash function with greedy method for all the 3 cases.
the compression ratio for case car is 0.37
the compression ratio for case chair is 0.58
the compression ratio for case lightbulb is 0.15


OFFSET SEARCH FOR EXTRA CREDIT:
If you implemented a search strategy instead of or in addition to the
greedy method from the paper, describe it here.
