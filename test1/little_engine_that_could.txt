A little steam engine had a long train of
cars to pull.  She went along very well
till she came to a steep hill. But then
no matter how hard she tried she could not
move the long train of cars.  She pulled and
she pulled. She puffed and she puffed. She
backed and started off again. Choo! Choo!
But no! The cars would not go up the hill.
